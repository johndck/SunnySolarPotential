# Sunny

## Introduction
Sunny is a web application designed to provide users with insightful information about solar potential based on geographical locations in the United Kingdom. Users can input their postcode, and the application fetches data to estimate solar panel potential, carbon offset, and other related details.
This project is an exploration of web development, incorporating features like real-time data fetching, dynamic content manipulation, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Features
1. Postcode-Based Solar Information
Users can input their postcode to receive information about solar potential in their area.
The application fetches data such as the estimated number of solar panels, available space for panels, total yearly sunshine hours, and carbon offset.
2. Search History
The app maintains a history of recent searches, allowing users to revisit locations quickly.
Recent searches are displayed as clickable buttons for convenient access.
3. Responsive Design
The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Bootstrap is utilised for a mobile-first design approach.

 ## Technologies Used
- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language used for designing the app's layout and appearance.
- JavaScript: Programming language used to implement dynamic functionality, fetch solar data, and update the DOM.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive and mobile-first design.
- Google Maps API: External API used to retrieve latitude and longitude details based on postcode.
- Solar API: External API used to estimate solar potential based on geographical coordinates.
